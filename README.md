## What is My Petful Shop (a Petful Project)?
"My Petful Shop" is our version of The Petful Project, a fullstack web-development project that is created around the principal of "FIFO"... first-in, first-out.

Whereby a user submits their name into a queue via the submission form on the homepage. When called to the "no. 1 spot", the user is given a message indicating their turn to "adopt" a fictional cat or dog from the available choices on the adoption page.

*"Here at "My Petful Shop", our adoption process works on a "FIFO" ("First-In, First-Out") basis. It's a philosophy we've developed with our local animal rescues to ensure that every cat and dog gets a loving "FURever" home.*
*So what are YOU waiting for...?*
*ENTER your name and CLICK the button below to JOIN our waiting list. Then once your name is pulled to the "#1 spot", you can ADOPT one of the pets in the available list."*
